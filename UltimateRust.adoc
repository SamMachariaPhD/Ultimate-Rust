== Introduction 

* Fundamentals are important in rust.
* System programming language.
* Good for `Safety`, `Concurrency`, and `Speed`.

[quote, Wikipedia, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concurrency_(computer_science)]
In computer science, #concurrency# is the ability of different parts or units of a program, algorithm, or problem to be executed out-of-order or in partial order, without affecting the final outcome.

* `Python` can give you safety but not concurrency or speed.
* `C/C++` will give you speed and some concurrency but not safety.
